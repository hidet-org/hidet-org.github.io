Add PyTorch Operator Mapping
============================

This guide describes how to add an operator mapping for PyTorch.

.. graphviz::
  :caption: The workflow of hidet backend of :code:`torch.compile(..., backend='hidet')`.

  digraph {
      // rankdir=LR;
      splines=curved;
      node [
          shape=box, style="rounded, filled",
          height=0.4, width=0.6, margin="0.2,0.10",
          fillcolor="#EEF0E5",
          color="#163020",
          fontcolor="#163020",
      ];
      edge [
          color="#163020",
          fontcolor="#163020",
      ];


      graph [style="rounded, dashed"]
          a [label="PyTorch nn.Module"];
          b [label="torch.fx.Graph"];
          c [label="hidet.FlowGraph"];
          d [label="hidet.runtime.CompiledGraph"];

          a -> b [label="   Step 1: PyTorch Dynamo"];
          b -> c [label="   Step 2: Operator mapping"];
          c -> d [label="   Step 3: FlowGraph building"];
  }

During step 2, we convert each pytorch operator to a hidet operator. In a `torch.fx.Graph`, there are three kinds of
operators that need to be converted:

1. functions (e.g., :code:`torch.nn.functional.relu`, :code:`torch.relu`, :code:`operator.add`, etc.)
2. modules (e.g., :code:`torch.nn.ReLU`, :code:`torch.nn.Linear`, etc.)
3. tensor methods (e.g., :code:`torch.Tensor.squeeze`, :code:`torch.Tensor.to`, etc.)

In this guide, we will show how to add the operator mapping for all the three kinds of operators.

1. Prepare Environment
----------------------
First, we remove some existing operator mapping (i.e., conversion) rules for demonstration purpose, and define an
example model.

2. Compile and Run the Model
----------------------------
If we compile and run the model, we will get an error that complains about the missing conversion rules for
:code:`torch.nn.Linear`, :code:`torch.nn.functional.relu` and :code:`operator.add`.

If we run the model again, it will complain about the missing conversion rule for :code:`torch.Tensor.flatten`.
It does not complain about missing conversion rule for :code:`torch.Tensor.flatten` before because we can not
know the type of the method's class (i.e., :code:`torch.Tensor`) before we actually run the model.

We put all the registration code in the following three modules:

1. :code:`hidet.graph.frontend.torch.register_functions` (all the functions in `torch.nn.functional.*` and
   `operator.*`)
2. :code:`hidet.graph.frontend.torch.register_modules` (all the modules in `torch.nn.*`)
3. :code:`hidet.graph.frontend.torch.register_methods` (all the methods in `torch.Tensor.*`)

Lots of operators have already been registered in the above three modules, and they are also good examples for us
to learn how to add operator mapping.

Usually, we will use the existing operators in hidet (defined in `hidet.ops.*`) to implement the pytorch operators.
If there are no corresponding operators in hidet, we can add the missing operators to `hidet.ops.*` by following the
guide :doc:`/how-to-guides/add-new-operator/index`.

.. note::
   The operator mapping rules are registered in the global registry. Thus, if we register the same operator mapping
   rules multiple times, only the last registration will take effect.

4. Summary
----------
In this guide, we show how to add operator mapping for PyTorch. We first remove some existing operator mapping rules
for demonstration purpose, and then add them back. We also show how to add operator mapping for functions, modules
and tensor methods.
