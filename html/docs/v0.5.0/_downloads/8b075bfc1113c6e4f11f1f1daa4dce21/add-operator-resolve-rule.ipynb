An operator\nresolve rule is used to resolve an operator to other operators. Usually, we would resolve a more generic operator to\nmore specific and efficient operators. The operator resolving rules allow us to reuse existing highly-optimized\noperators to implement a new operator, while organizing the operators in a more modular way.\n\n\n## Operator Resolving\n\nThe core idea of the **operator resolving** is to resolve a generic operator to more specific and high-optimized\noperators. When we define a new operator, we can also attach an operator resolve rule to it. The rule defines how to\nresolve the operator to other operators with the same semantics. After the operator is resolved, the original operator\nwill be replaced by the resolved operators. This process is transparent to the user and is done automatically by a pass\nwhen we optimize a flow graph.\n\nThere are typical two scenarios that we need to resolve an operator to other operators:\n\n- **Resolve a generic operator to specialized variants**: We can provide a generic operator and lots of its specialized\n  variants. When optimizing the model, we can resolve the generic operator to the most suitable specialized operator.\n  For example, in Hidet, we provided a generic :py:func:`~hidet.ops.matmul` operator with the same semantics as\n  the numpy equivalent :py:data:`numpy.matmul`. This operator is a generic operator and is scheduled automatically by\n  our auto-scheduler, thus it is not very efficient. But we also provided a lot of specialized variants of the operators\n  such as highly-optimized :py:func:`~hidet.ops.batch_matmul` that only accepts $A=[B, M, K]$ and\n  $B=[B, K, N]$. During the operator resolving, we first reshape and broadcast the input tensors to align the\n  input shapes with the specialized operator, then use the specialized operator to compute the result, and finally\n  reshape the output tensor to get the correct output shape.\n\n.. tip::\n  :class: margin\n\n  During the operator resolving, we might introduce some extra operators to adjust the input tensors (e.g.,\n  :func:`~hidet.ops.reshape`, :func:`~hidet.ops.broadcast`, :func:`~hidet.ops.transpose`, etc.).\n  These extra operators are usually fused into the resolved operators or surrounding operators of the original operator\n  in the later optimization pass. Thus, the extra overhead is usually negligible.\n\n.. figure:: /_static/img/resolve-example-matmul.svg\n    :align: center\n    :scale: 70%\n\n    The resolve rule for `Matmul` operator.\n\n- **Reuse a new operator to existing operators**: When we add a new operator and the new operator can be implemented by\n  existing operators, we can use a resolve rule to resolve the new operator to the existing highly-optimized operators\n  to reduce the development effort.\n\n.. figure:: /_static/img/resolve-example-conv2d.svg\n    :align: center\n    :scale: 70%\n\n    This rule resolves the generic :func:`~hidet.ops.conv2d` operator to matrix multiplication using the img2col\n    algorithm.\n\nThe operator resolving pass would repeat the resolving process until no more operators can be resolved. Thus, in the\nconv2d example, we will first resolve :func:`~hidet.ops.conv2d` to :func:`~hidet.ops.matmul`, and then\nto :func:`~hidet.ops.batch_matmul`.\n\n## Add Operator Resolve Rule\n\nTo add a resolve rule to an operator, we need to\n\n#. define a subclass of :class:`~hidet.graph.transforms.resolve_variant.ResolveRule` and then\n#. register the rule by decorating it with :func:`~hidet.graph.transforms.resolve_variant.register_resolve_rule`.\n\nIn the following example, we resolve the :func:`~hidet.ops.pow` operator to normal multiplications if the exponent\nis a constant integer 3.\n\nBefore we start, let's have a look at the original behavior when there is no such resolve rule.\n"
